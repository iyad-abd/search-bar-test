    title: "PAR (Participatory Action Research) - ReACT Method",
    content: "The term \"PAR\" in the context of React refers to the \"ReACT\" method, a participatory action research (PAR) approach designed to engage youth in problem identification, data analysis, and feedback stages of research, thereby promoting local knowledge production and critical consciousness. This method, specifically known as Youth Research Actualizing Critical Thought (ReACT), uses a series of \"messaging games\" to train participants in qualitative data analysis, including activities like Candy Sorting, Memory Match, Message Scavenger Hunt, and the Newspaper Editor Game. The ReACT method is distinct from the JavaScript library React, which is a separate entity used for building user interfaces."
